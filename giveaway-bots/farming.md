# Mining mode

You just need to have a Giveaway Bot in your wallet and you will periodically receive earnings. 

Each faction will have a separate pool that will be replenished each Monday at 00h00 UTC. If the pool is dry before it, no more mining will be done for that faction.

Rules about mining, mining power and size of pool may vary from week to week on the best interest of the token value. We don't want to play the _**Beta**_ card here, but it will be a _**Beta**_.

### **Main Formula for earnings calculation**

_Earnings = \(\(Pool remain / Number of remaining days till Monday\) / Number of faction players mining\) \* Faction random factor_

| Faction | Faction random factor |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rust | 40% - 50% |
| Iron | 50% - 60% |
| Aquamarine | 60% - 70% |
| Stark | 70% - 80% |
| Gold | 80% - 90% |
| Watermelon | 90% - 100% |

### **So, i should get a Watermelon, right?**

Not exactly. The pool size itself replenished each Monday will vary according to the game interactions and wins. If in a particular week, Rust wins a lot of games \(force in numbers\), then the Rust pool will be higher than the Watermelon. We will elaborate more about the calculation of the pool size when the game is nearly completion \(Q1 2022\).

On Q4 2021 we will replenish the pool using the following formula

_Pool size = Total destined pool tokens \* \(total number of faction players/total number of players\)_

So for this quarter, watermelon will be beneficial. But once the game starts things may change.
